# Solution Overview

The Contoso Sales Assistant is a conversational agent designed to answer questions about sales data, generate charts, and create Excel files for further analysis.

The app is built using the [Azure AI Agents Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/){:target="_blank"} and leverages the [Azure OpenAI gpt-4o](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions){:target="_blank"} LLM.

It utilizes a read-only SQLite Contoso Sales Database containing 40,000 rows of synthetic data. Upon startup, the app reads the sales database schema, product categories, product types, and reporting years, then incorporates this data into the Azure AI Agent Service’s instruction context.

## Extending the Workshop Solution

The workshop solution is highly adaptable to various scenarios, such as customer support, by modifying the database and tailoring the Azure AI Agent Service instructions to suit specific use cases. It is intentionally designed to be UX-agnostic, allowing you to focus on the core functionality of the AI Agent Service and apply the foundational concepts to build your own conversational agent.

### Best Practices Demonstrated in the App

- **Asynchronous APIs**:  
  The workshop sample uses asynchronous APIs for both the Azure AI Agent Service and SQLite, ensuring efficient resource utilization and improved scalability. This approach is especially valuable when deploying the app in a production environment with asynchronous web frameworks such as FastAPI, Chainlit, or Streamlit.

- **Token Streaming**:  
  Token streaming is implemented to improve user experience by reducing perceived response times for the LLM-powered agent app.
